# Lock Out Protocol

Lock Out Protocol is a 2D-zombie survival game, played from a top-down perspective. Lock Out Protocol is a joint effort of programming, designing, and planning between [Ronald Abrams](https://github.com/rgabrams), [Rinty Chowdhury](https://github.com/rintychy), and [Joshua Crotts](https://github.com/JoshuaCrotts) for CSC - 340: Software Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The underlying engine stems from one of Joshua's earlier projects (in conjunction with [Andrew Matzureff](https://github.com/AndrewMatzureff)) known as the [Standards](https://github.com/JoshuaCrotts/Standards) library. For this project, Standards is used as an abstract concept and tool, as the predominant goal of this project is to develop an application, not an engine for said application. More specifically, there are a plethra of concepts, optimizations, and miscellaneous ideas that go into crafting a game engine. As such, one semester is not nearly enough time to make a proper game, along with its complex engine.

## Running Lock Out Protocol
To run the game, simply download the executable/jar file if on Windows, or if on Linux/MacOS, download just the jar. Be warned: if you are on a non-Windows machine, the animations may not be displayed properly.

## Rebuilding Lock Out Protocol

All source code is located in the /src/ directory. To rebuild the code in NetBeans 8.2, Java 8 is required (either Oracle, Amazon Corretto, or OpenJDK). Any arbitrary flavor of Java 8 is most likely acceptable.

Create a new project in any IDE, then clone the repository inside of the src/ folder of the aforesaid project. At this point, all files should be present and available to compile and run.

## Reporting Bugs

## Version History
The **master** branch encompasses significant development changes in the project, whereas the three other branches house various experimentation and states of progression. These branch are constantly evolving. Rarely (whenever it is best), the master branch is updated to mimic one of these three branches.
